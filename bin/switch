# switch between test and dev composer

# The tests require an autoload mapping from \phpbb -> tests/stumps/phpbb.
#
# However, if a module is a child, autoload-dev is loaded as a regular autoload
# (for some stupid reason) so that does the mapping too. Defining the a
# \phpbb mapping in "autoload" breaks the tests (IIRC).
#
# So there are two versons of composure:
#
# - test-composer.json: includes the autoload mapping and is used when running tests
# - dev-compossers.json: does not have the autoload mapping and is used when running the server
#
# This script switches between the two
